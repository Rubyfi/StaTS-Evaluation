  Read/Write race. Non-private method `GraphNumbers.chalkboardAndBar()` indirectly reads with synchronization from `this.privateNumbers.total`. Potentially races with unsynchronized write in method `GraphNumbers.internalUpdate()`.
 Reporting because another access to the same memory occurs on a background thread, although this access may not.
